Go ?
    1. Concurrency
    2. Implicit implementation of interfaces
    3. Standard library
    4. Simplicity (only 25 keywords)
    5. Easy to unit test, inbuilt testing framework
    6. Compiling to native code
    7. Performance compared to C
    8. Higher Order Functions
    9. Built in Garbage Collection

Higher Order Functions
    Functions are treated as data
        1. Functions can be assigned to variables
        2. Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
        3. Functions can be returned by other functions
        4. Closures

Goroutines
    1. Go routines are lightweight threads of execution
    2. 4KB of stack space
    3. Go runtine has a builtin scheduler
    4. 'go' keyword

    Channels
        ch := make(chan int)

        sending data to the channel
            ch <- 10
            blocking operation?
                it depends...
                    if a read operation on the channel is not initiated yet, then the write operation will be blocked
                    If the channel is a buffered channel and the channel is full, then the write operation will be blocked

        receiving data from the channel
            val := <- ch
            receiving data from the channel is a blocking operation

    Never assume during Concurrency programming
        1. Time taken for a goroutine to complete
        2. Sequence of execution of goroutines

    Communication Patterns
        Request & Response
        Server Streaming (one request & multiple responses)
        Client Streaming (multiple requests & one response)
        Bidirectional Streaming (multiple requests & multiple responses)

Steps
    1. Define the contract (service, operation, message (input & output)) (using protobuf)
    2. Generate the proxy & stub
    3. Implement the service & host the server (server-side)
    4. Use the proxy to call the server (client-side)

Tools:
    
    Installation
        go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
        go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest

        (when the above is installed, executables are created in the gopath/bin folder. Make sure this path is set in environment variables)

    Windows
        Install the binaries from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/

    Mac
        brew install protoc-gen-go
        brew install protoc-gen-go-grpc

to generate proxy & stub
    protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative proto/service.proto


Http Services
    1. Builtin APIs
    2. Use libraries
        routing
        middleware
    3. Use frameworks

Server Sent Events (http)
    Headers from server
        content-type : 'text/event-stream'
        connection : 'keep-alive'

    Messages from the server
        event:<event_name>\n
        data:<data>\n\n

Web Sockets (ws) (on http)

Code Generation
    AST
        https://yuroyoro.github.io/goast-viewer/index.html
    Reflection
    Templates

    go generate ./...

Distributed Tracing
    Tracing
        Following the execution flow

    Span
        Unit of Work
        Encapsulates Unique Identifier, operation name, start & finish timestamp, and any other contextual information (tags, logs or events)
        Span can be nested
            parent span Identifier

    Trace
        directed graph of spans where edges between the spans are defined as parent/child relationships

    DistributedContext
        Contains tracing identifiers, tags etc that are propogated from parent to child

Profiling
    pprof

    Steps:
        1. Identify the bottlenecks
        2. Isolate the bottlenecks
        3. Profile the isolated bottlenecks
        4. Analyze the profile
        5. Fix the issues

1. Add the following package
    _ "net/http/pprof"

2. Subject the application to a load
    go-wrk -c 10 -d 10s http://localhost:8080/primes

3. Access profile data
    go tool pprof -seconds 5 http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile
    use commands to investigate
        top10
        top10 -cum
        list <function name>
        disasm <function name>

Flamegraph profile analysis
    go tool pprof -http=":9090" <binary_name> <profile_file>

Memory Allocations
    go test -bench=. -benchmem

Creating CPU profile
    go test -bench=. -cpuprofile=cpu.out

Creating Memory profile
    go test -bench=. -memprofile=mem.out

To investigate memory allocations
    go tool pprof -alloc_objects <binary_name> <profile_file>
